This is a Node API starter project. It uses TypeScript. It also uses Express for Routing.

---
## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, installed in your environement.

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    vXX.XX.XX

    $ npm --version
    XX.XX.XX

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

### Project installation

##  Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/jwp8807/Node-API-TypeScript-Template
    $ cd PROJECT_TITLE
    $ npm install

## Running the project

    $ npm run dev

###  Testing the API

## Postman
    Postman is a tool we'll use to test the REST API endpoints.

- #### Postman installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Postman website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and download it from there.

  Once you have it installed, run a GET request to the URL: http://localhost:3000/test to get a response back in JSON format.
